<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Thanks to social media, food bloggers, and celebrity chefs with too much time on their hands, pork belly was/is all the rage. It's a common sight on menus across the land, and you can't channel-surf past a food show without seeing it. It also helps that people are no longer terrified to eat a little fat.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>½ pound whole pork belly, skin removed </li>
    <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika, or to taste </li>
    <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste </li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Season pork belly all over with smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Wrap pork in parchment paper; wrap a second time in aluminum foil, and a third time in another sheet of aluminum foil. Place pork packet in a baking dish.</li>
    <li>Roast in the preheated oven until tender for 6 hours. Let cool in wrappings to room temperature; place cooled packet in refrigerator and chill for 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Unwrap chilled meat. Save any rendered fat that falls away when unwrapping pork.</li>
    <li>Cut meat into 6 equal-size portions. Cut 1/8-inch by 1/8-inch slashes in the fat-side of the pork. Season with salt.</li>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons reserved pork fat in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork belly, fat side down, in hot fat; cook until well-browned on all sides and heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer pork belly to a plate, drizzle with olive oil and season with pepper.</li>
